      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p>Permanent Traveler &nbsp;·&nbsp; Effective date: February 17, 2026</p>
    </header>

    <section>
      <div class="highlight">
        Your data never leaves your device. Permanent Traveler has no servers, no accounts, no analytics, and no third-party SDKs. Everything stays on your iPhone.
      </div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>What This App Does</h2>
      <p>Permanent Traveler helps you record which country you are in each day. It tracks your location in the background, converts it to a country name, and stores that information locally on your device so you can review your travel history over time.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Location Data</h2>
      <p>The app collects your location to determine which country you are in. Specifically:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Location is collected using iOS significant-location-change monitoring, which triggers only when you move a meaningful distance (approximately 3 km). It does not continuously sample your GPS.</li>
        <li>Precise coordinates are converted on your device to a country name, city, and region using Apple's built-in reverse geocoding. The raw GPS coordinates are not stored.</li>
        <li>The app requests reduced-accuracy location by default, meaning the system provides the least precise location needed to determine your country.</li>
        <li>Background location access is requested so the app can record your country even when not open. When active, iOS displays a location indicator in your status bar.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>All location data is stored only on your device using Apple's SwiftData framework. It is never transmitted, uploaded, or shared.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>What Is Stored on Your Device</h2>
      <p>The app stores the following information locally:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Daily location logs</strong> — country, city, and region for each day, whether recorded automatically or entered manually by you.</li>
        <li><strong>Planned trips</strong> — future travel dates, destination country, city, and any notes you add.</li>
        <li><strong>Preferences</strong> — your default location, residency alert threshold, calendar start day, and dismissed alert history.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>None of this data is linked to your identity, an account, or any external profile. There are no user accounts in this app.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Data We Do Not Collect</h2>
      <div class="highlight">We do not collect, transmit, or store any of the following:</div>
      <ul>
        <li>Your name, email address, or any personal identifiers</li>
        <li>Raw GPS coordinates or precise location history</li>
        <li>Device identifiers or advertising IDs</li>
        <li>Usage analytics or behavioral data</li>
        <li>Crash reports or diagnostic logs sent to us</li>
        <li>Payment or financial information</li>
        <li>Contacts, photos, or any other data outside of location</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Third Parties</h2>
      <p>Permanent Traveler contains no third-party SDKs, analytics libraries, advertising networks, or crash reporting tools. The only external services involved are Apple's own frameworks — CoreLocation for location monitoring and CLGeocoder for on-device reverse geocoding — which are subject to <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apple's Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
      <p>We do not sell, share, rent, or disclose your data to any third party.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Deleting Your Data</h2>
      <p>You can delete all data stored by the app at any time. Open the app, go to <strong>Settings → Delete All Data</strong>. This permanently removes all location history, planned trips, and preferences from your device. This action cannot be undone.</p>
      <p>Uninstalling the app from your device also removes all associated data.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
      <p>Permanent Traveler is not directed at children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect any information from children. Because all data is stored locally and no information is transmitted or collected by us, no special data handling for children is required. If you believe a child has used the app, you can delete all data at any time from within the app's Settings.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Your Rights</h2>
      <p>Because all data is stored locally on your device and we have no servers or accounts, we do not hold any of your personal data. You have full control at all times:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Access</strong> — all your data is visible within the app.</li>
        <li><strong>Correction</strong> — you can edit or override any day's location manually.</li>
        <li><strong>Deletion</strong> — use Settings → Delete All Data, or uninstall the app.</li>
        <li><strong>Portability</strong> — your data never leaves your device, so it is always in your possession.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
      <p>If this policy changes, the updated version will be published at this URL with a revised effective date. Continued use of the app after any change constitutes acceptance of the updated policy. We will only make material changes if the app's data practices change — and given the privacy-first design of this app, that is not anticipated.</p>
    </section>
